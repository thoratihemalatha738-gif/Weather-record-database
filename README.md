Weather Record System — C Language Project

I recently developed a Weather Record System using the C programming language, focusing on concepts like unions,file handlings,structures, arrays, pointers and functions to efficiently manage and analyze weather data.

The system is designed to record, store, and display daily weather information, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Users can enter multiple records, view summaries, and retrieve specific data easily. The project highlights how fundamental programming principles can be applied to solve real-world problems like data management and analysis.

By using structures, I organized weather attributes into a single logical unit, while arrays allowed me to handle multiple records efficiently. Functions helped divide the program into modular, reusable components, improving code readability and reducing redundancy.

This project enhanced my understanding of data handling, modular programming, and problem-solving in C, as well as the importance of efficient data organization and user interaction in software design.

Overall, building this Weather Record System strengthened my skills in C programming fundamentals, logic development, and structured program design — laying a solid foundation for more advanced software development projects.
